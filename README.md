I have written about this project in detail here: https://medium.com/@sarim.mehdi.550/trajectory-prediction-for-adas-d1210e01f15

Robust pipeline that includes 3D object detection plus trajectory prediction. A lot of work is in progress but will be completed by mid August.
Your folder structure should look like this (label_2, DETS2D and DETS3D are folders that contain label files for each frame)
```
